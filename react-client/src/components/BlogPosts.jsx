              <h4>The Great Currency Erosion</h4>
              <h6>March 1, 2020</h6>
              <p></p>
              <em> The COVID-19 epidemic will likely lead to global stimulus from central banks. But the geopolitical implications of monetary policy have never been more intertwined between nations, and as interest rates teeter to negative territory, central banks may pump themselves into an existential crisis. </em>
              <p></p>
              U.S. Federal Reserve officials recently discussed contingency plans for the next recession, which included capped yields on Treasuries last used in post-World War II monetary policy. Capped rates could implicitly drive inflation higher and serve as a near-term remedy to deflationary fears and negative interest rates. But given the instability of the current state of global markets (as evidenced in this past week), it is more likely we see coordinated rate cuts approaching negative territory and cash infusions by each country’s central bank. As we’ll discuss below, this global infusion of capital could accelerate a path to extreme consequences including hyper-inflation. If this seemingly unlikely scenario were to unravel, not only would central banks have trouble curbing it, but it would be the first time in economic history they will also have to compete with stateless, digital, tokens of exchange.
              <p></p>
              If we enter a period of hyper-inflation, traditional economic and monetary theory suggests that central banks could raise interest rates to stem inflation, but these macro tools may prove to be antiquated in today’s world. Specifically, the geopolitical implications of domestic monetary policy have never been as related as they are today. The world is significantly more globalized and thus, socially and economically intertwined. While we could compare the historical flows of money between nations or the increase in travel of the younger generations relative to the Boomers, the spread of COVID-19 to every continent excluding Antarctica in a matter of weeks and its rippling effect through global markets should provide sufficient evidence in itself.
              <p></p>
              While historical precedents have largely proved central banks function best by remaining independent from federal fiscal policy, governments have increasingly used currency as a political tool for trade negotiations and sanctions. Given the intersection of global economies, this dichotomy has resulted in the modern interest rate dilemma; if a nation’s currency becomes too strong relative to its trading peers, export products will become more expensive and current account deficits will widen. This reality paired with a low growth economy in most developed nations has created sustained downward pressure on central banks to lower interest rates globally. And this trend will likely exacerbate in the upcoming quarters and beyond following COVID-19.
              <p></p>
              Meanwhile, post-financial crisis monetary policy has helped asset growth significantly outpace wage growth in the U.S. and other developed nations. Low or negative interest rates have encouraged investors to pile into riskier and higher yielding assets. Even after last week’s market crash, the NASDAQ has increased at a ~14.5% CAGR since 2010 while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 have increased at a 9% and 10% CAGR, respectively. Annual capital inflows to venture capital have at least doubled since 2010 while private equity’s assets under management reached over $4 trillion last year. Still, total wage growth has significantly lagged, increasing at a ~5.5% CAGR while average annual pay has increased at a ~2.3% CAGR over a similar time period according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In public equity markets, mature companies have increased balance sheet leverage to buy back stock for shareholders, worsening the asset accumulation to wage growth gap. Another coordinated wave of stimulus would likely widen this gap even further.
              <p></p>
              As evidenced by the waves of populism sweeping across countries, multiple elections have already proven that many individuals feel they have been left behind in this elongated economic recovery stemming from the 2008 financial crisis. And as central banks once again choose to pump and trump confidence into markets on the heels of this potential pandemic, they risk eroding further trust.
              <p></p>
              Historically, citizens of a nation were required to transact in their domestic currencies. But since the last financial crisis, new digital currencies have been developed or proposed outside the ownership of nation states. And while these alternatives are frequently dismissed by notable investors and government officials, the younger generation seems to disagree; as of Q3:19, a digital currency trust was the fifth greatest holding across a group of equities in millennial retirement accounts according to a recent financial adviser report. Evidently, global central banks are facing a critical juncture. Their responses to COVID-19 and the long-term economic ramifications, including potential hyper-inflation, may further accelerate the path to greater adoption of stateless, tokens of exchange.

              <h4>Unit Economics, Cheap Capital, Paths to Profitability - My Learnings From 2019's IPOs </h4>
              <h6>January 26, 2020</h6>
              <p></p>
              2019 featured some of the largest IPOs by market cap and capital raised in the private markets. Yes, it is still too early to judge the successes of these companies in the public markets. But how we got here and the implications rippling down the entire Internet investment ecosystem following their IPOs and their profit (really, loss) disclosures are worth studying. While we can talk through WeWork on one side of the spectrum, other smaller offerings, or even contrast them with Alibaba’s strong Hong Kong secondary, I will focus on learnings from Uber and Lyft. Across my 90+ cumulative conversations with potential investors during their respective IPOs (and many more since), the top questions were centered around three core topics: 1) unit economics of the industry; 2) the competitive environment; and, 3) each company’s respective paths to profitability. Why were these questions so important? This was the first time in the history of our financial markets that private companies went public with expected losses of these magnitudes. How did we get here and what can we learn going forward? Sit down and buckle up!
              <p></p>
              <strong>UNIT ECONOMICS</strong>
              <p></p>
              Walking through the basic unit economics of Uber and Lyft’s ride sharing business to investors was a harder task than in traditional industries. For those unfamiliar with unit economics, we'll do a quick analysis of a “static” industry like the traditional taxi industry. For simplicity’s sake, we can say that each additional $10 taxi ride will result in $7 going to the driver (30% Net Revenue Margin or Take Rate), $2 going to the dispatcher and core operations, $0.50 marketing, and so forth. Except the ride sharing industries have highly dynamic pricing models. While these dynamic pricing models have resulted in significant efficiencies in these operational processes, it also created real-time, shifting unit economics across each region of operation based on the competitive environment at a given moment.
              <p></p>
              By the time Uber and Lyft geared up to go public they had not demonstrated a history of consistent unit economics akin to the “duopolistic” ride sharing market structure that has evolved in the U.S. today. Based on public regulatory filings, Uber earned close to a ~20% take rate on its ride sharing business at the time of its IPO; however the company expected that number to contract as it continued to expand internationally and fight off competitors (see Didi’s investment in Latin America - ironically Uber divested its China business and now owns ~15% of Didi). And we have yet to discuss the Uber Eats business, which carries a lower mature margin profile and current take rate of half the Rides business as food-delivery is a three-sided marketplace and includes restaurant operators. (I plan to publish a separate analysis on the food delivery industry… for now, I will direct readers to Waitr Holdings (NASDAQ: WTRH).
              <p></p>
              Following the IPO, the Lyft management team explained in a meeting that “public investors threw a bucket of ice water onto the industry." But they meant this in a very positive way. Uber has shared similar thoughts on earnings calls since their offering. No longer was each company stuck in the prisoner’s dilemma paradox that plagued the ride sharing industry. Specifically, the irrational (but necessary) decision to subsidize and discount rides to gain share or match the other to maintain share. Instead, rational price increases between both companies have increased prices for consumers (though remain lower than the traditional taxi industry), leading to improving unit economics across the industry.
              <p></p>
              While it was tough for the management teams to provide detailed unit economics of their businesses given the dynamic nature of the industry and for competitive reasons, greater clarity on long-term unit economics could have better helped assuage investor concerns.
              <p></p>
              <strong>CHEAP CAPITAL & COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS</strong>
              <p></p>
              Leading into their IPO’s, the breakneck growth rates of each company envied by their Silicon Valley peers became an increasingly boisterous metric. The supposed cultural perils of TK’s relentless focus on growth was well covered by the media. But from a business perspective, why was rapid growth and scale such an important goal for Uber as it matured? The taxi industry was a historically inefficient marketplace. Meanwhile, in an efficient two-sided marketplace with a clear consumer value proposition, more supply (drivers) begets operation liquidity (lower wait times and fares), which begets demand (more riders), which results in more rides per hour and earnings per driver, which in turn attracts more drivers. In their S-1, Uber called this their “Liquidity Network Effect.” As we just discussed, in the years leading into their public offerings, both companies and their competitors focused largely on gaining incremental market-share which was fueled by continued private fundraising rounds. This seemingly free-flowing, cheap capital environment in the private markets allowed the companies to grow—at least what some public investors would describe as—imprudently. But the market leader needed to spend aggressively in order to win markets from their newly capitalized peers to create this greater liquidity network effect and superior unit economics.
              <p></p>
              The venture and growth capital firms recognized that a company with dominant market share in the ride sharing industry would facilitate a stronger liquidity network effect, a boon for investors. This caused a massive flood of private capital investments into the industry (at least $40 billion based on public disclosures). How was so much sidelined capital available to multiple players in the private markets for an industry that was less than a decade old? This is a tough question. Some in the industry will point fingers at certain funds. But I believe the underlying reason is an indirect consequence of recent monetary policy. Low interest rates and the resulting cheap capital pumped into economies by central banks since the last financial crises snowballed into an accumulation of asset wealth. This has permeated into private technology investment vehicles over the last decade. Cheap capital, coupled with the allure of investing in the next Alibaba, Tencent, Google, Facebook, etc., created a capital infusion influx that the venture industry had never seen before. And these massive capital deployments have accelerated industry growth curves, perhaps all too quickly.
              <p></p>
              Regardless of how we got there, abundant capital was the reality in Silicon Valley leading into the mega Internet IPOs of 2019. Eventually, smaller ride-sharing upstarts (Juno, etc.) were taken out by well-capitalized and operationally stronger peers. During this “wash-out” process, these companies were providing substantial discounts to riders to use their platform. And consumers became trained to expect frequent discounting in the ride sharing industry, while convenience (driver liquidity) & price (discounting) remained the two most important attributes on the consumer side of the marketplace. This created an environment where switching costs for the consumer were near zero. Excessive discounting, usually masked to juice growth metrics, became a very common user acquisition strategy across consumers start-ups beyond ride sharing over the last decade, many of which proved to be unsustainable. One example that comes to mind is Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN). While this transition is not new, perhaps the learnings of 2019’s mega IPOs will remind investors to focus on organic growth metrics instead of generic growth.

              <strong>PATHS TO PROFITABILITY</strong>
              <p></p>
              As we discussed earlier, Analysts initially modeled ~$4B in 2019 Adjusted EBITDA losses for Uber and ~$1B in losses for Lyft at the time of the IPO. Perhaps more importantly, the management teams were not able to share a direct timeline of positive profitability for their companies. Most Analysts were modeling positive profitability some time beyond 2022. These losses and lack of clarity surrounding timing were concerning for many public investors.
              <p></p>
              These outlooks may be starting to change since both companies have been operating with higher operational efficiency. Though each stock has underperformed the market, Analysts have modeled consistent positive profitability revisions. And since their IPOs, each company’s potential path to profitability has become increasingly transparent.
              <p></p>
              Lyft recently guided investors to positive profitability by Q4 2021 while Uber guided investors to positive profitability for the full year of 2021. We will find out full year profitability metrics in the coming weeks when Uber and Lyft report their Q4 2019 earnings results. Uber’s current full year guidance of $2.8B to $2.9B in Adjusted EBITDA losses are more than ~$1B ahead of Analyst expectations just 6 months ago. Lyft’s current full year guidance is $708MM to $718MM, also ahead of initial investor expectations.
              <p></p>
              Each company appears to be taking steps to divest from unprofitable and losing initiatives. Just last week, Uber sold its India Uber Eats division to local rival Zomato. And pricing rationalization that has occurred in more mature markets may lead to potential pricing power, while margin leverage on expenses will likely continue as each company scales.
              <p></p>
              Still, tepid public investor interest of these decacorn IPO’s in 2019 (and even one’s that did not get off the ground) have undoubtedly led to an increased focus across executive boards and management teams on delivering healthy and sustainable unit economics, clear paths to profitability, and better stewardship of the abundant capital that has flooded the private tech markets. And if they haven’t, they should take note, as other industry margins could become unnecessarily compressed…
